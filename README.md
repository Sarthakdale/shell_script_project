## ðŸš€ OUTPUT
1. When the aws cli is not installed it gives the error. This is handled by the robust error handling method in the code
 ![ss1 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462d80c6-4052-4613-8de4-ce933f4dc509)

2. If the specified format is not given at the command line argument it handles the error by showing the format in which argument should be passed
   ![ss2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17a1aba-08dc-4e85-a582-103c5bbe4849)
3. if the aws cli is not configured before interacting with the aws then it raises an error whihc is handled by the code by saying "please configure the cli"
   ![ss3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45489dca-95d5-475c-ac7a-3e499e45416c)
4. The configuration is done by setting the location to south-ap-1 and output file format as json
   ![ss4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698a65dd-14a1-471b-b4c7-44c6c85f0782)
